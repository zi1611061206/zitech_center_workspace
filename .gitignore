#   For a library or package, you might want to ignore these files since the code is
#   intended to run in multiple environments; otherwise, check them in:
# .python-version

# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock
#   If you are using Pipenv for dependency management, check this in.
# Pipfile.lock

# poetry
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include poetry.lock
#   If you are using Poetry for dependency management, check this in.
# poetry.lock

# pdm
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock and poetry.lock, it is generally recommended to include pdm.lock
#   If you are using PDM for dependency management, check this in.
# pdm.lock
