# Active Context for Zi Coder Agent

## Current Focus
- **Documentation Completion**: Finalizing a comprehensive documentation structure using MkDocs to ensure all project aspects are thoroughly detailed and accessible, providing a solid foundation for development and user onboarding.

## Active Decisions
- **MkDocs with Material Theme**: Committed to using MkDocs with the Material theme for its modern, responsive design and user-friendly documentation interface, enhancing readability and navigation.
- **Documentation Structure**: Organizing documentation into logical categories (Project Overview, Setup, Usage, Project Management, Knowledge Base) to align with project modules and cater to diverse user needs, from developers to end-users.
- **Content Depth**: Prioritizing detailed, project-specific content over placeholder text in all core documentation files to ensure immediate utility and relevance.

## Recent Changes
- **Core Documentation Enhancement**: Significantly updated key files including Product Requirement Document, Architecture, Technical Specifications, and Tasks Plan with detailed, project-specific information, moving beyond initial placeholders.
- **Navigation Update**: Fully configured the navigation structure in `mkdocs.yml` to include all documentation files, ensuring seamless access through the MkDocs site.
- **Server Running**: MkDocs development server is active at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`, allowing real-time preview and review of documentation updates.

## Next Steps
- **Documentation Review**: Conduct a thorough review of remaining documentation files (`error-documentation.mdc`, `lessons-learned.mdc`) to expand content with practical examples and project-specific insights.
- **API Development Kickoff**: Begin detailed development and testing of API endpoints, focusing on integration with AI models for coding assistance, as outlined in the Tasks Plan.
- **User Feedback Integration**: Solicit initial user feedback on documentation usability and content completeness to identify gaps or areas for further clarification before advancing to deeper technical implementation.

*Note: This document will be updated regularly to reflect the evolving focus, active decisions, recent changes, and immediate next steps as the project progresses through its development lifecycle.*
