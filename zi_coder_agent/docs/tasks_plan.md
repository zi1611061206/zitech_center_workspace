# Tasks Plan for Zi Coder Agent

## Current Tasks
- **Setup Documentation**: Establish comprehensive project documentation using MkDocs, ensuring all core files are detailed and accessible through the navigation structure.
- **API Development**: Enhance API endpoints for better integration and functionality, focusing on user interaction with AI assistance features.
- **Model Integration**: Integrate new AI models for improved coding assistance, including support for code generation, debugging, and optimization.
- **Database Optimization**: Refine database schemas and migration scripts using SQLAlchemy and Alembic to support scalability and data management needs.
- **Caching Implementation**: Implement and test Redis-based caching strategies to optimize API response times and reduce load on AI models.
- **Worker Task Management**: Develop and test Celery configurations for asynchronous task processing, ensuring efficient handling of long-running operations.
- **MCP Server Connectivity**: Establish secure and reliable connections to external MCP servers for extended tool and resource access.

## Project Progress
- **Documentation**: Setup is advanced with core files like Product Requirement Document, Architecture, and Technical Specifications now detailed. Navigation structure in MkDocs is fully updated to include all documentation.
- **Server Setup**: Initial server setup and virtual environment configurations are documented and operational, with Flask server running and Swagger UI accessible.
- **API Structure**: Basic API endpoints are defined in the codebase, with ongoing enhancements for AI integration.
- **Testing Framework**: Initial setup for testing with `pytest` is in place, with test scripts for API server, database, and management components created.

## Current Status
- The project is progressing through the foundational setup phase, with a strong focus on comprehensive documentation to ensure clarity for future development stages. API and model integration are the next priorities, building on the established environment and server configurations.

## Known Issues
- **Documentation Depth**: Some documentation files still contain placeholder content in sections that require further technical detail or project-specific examples.
- **Model Integration Delays**: Integration of AI models is pending detailed specification of supported frameworks and performance benchmarks.
- **Scalability Testing**: Full testing of scalability features with Celery and Redis under high load has not yet been conducted, which may reveal performance bottlenecks.
- **Security Protocols**: Detailed security measures for API interactions and MCP server communications need to be finalized and documented.

## Timeline and Milestones
- **Week 1-2**: Complete detailed documentation for all core project aspects, ensuring no placeholder content remains.
- **Week 3-4**: Finalize API endpoint development with full Swagger documentation and initial user testing.
- **Week 5-6**: Integrate and test primary AI models for coding assistance, establishing baseline performance metrics.
- **Week 7-8**: Implement and stress-test caching and worker management systems, optimizing for concurrent task handling.
- **Week 9-10**: Secure MCP server integrations with documented protocols and conduct security audits of API interactions.
- **End of Month 3**: Achieve a stable beta release with core functionalities operational, comprehensive documentation, and initial user feedback incorporated.
