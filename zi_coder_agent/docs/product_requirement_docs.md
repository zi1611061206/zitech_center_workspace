# Product Requirement Document (PRD) for Zi Coder Agent

## Purpose
Zi Coder Agent is designed to revolutionize the coding experience by providing AI-driven assistance, enhancing developer productivity, and streamlining workflow efficiency through intelligent automation and context-aware suggestions.

## Core Requirements
- **AI Assistance**: Integration of advanced AI models to support code generation, debugging, optimization, and automated testing, tailored to various programming languages and frameworks.
- **Modular Architecture**: Implementation of a modular system with distinct components for model management, MCP server management, cache management, worker management, database interactions, and API services to ensure flexibility and maintainability.
- **User Interface**: Development of a user-friendly web-based interface using Flask and Swagger UI for seamless interaction with the agent, allowing users to manage tasks, view API documentation, and test endpoints directly.
- **Scalability**: Design the system to handle multiple concurrent tasks, scale with user demand, and support distributed processing using tools like Celery and Redis for task queuing and caching.
- **Database Integration**: Utilize SQLAlchemy and Alembic for robust database management and migrations, supporting SQLite and PostgreSQL for data persistence.
- **Environment Compatibility**: Ensure the agent operates across Windows, macOS, and Linux environments with setup instructions for virtual environments using both `uv` and `pip`.

## Goals
- **Automation**: Streamline development processes by automating repetitive tasks such as code formatting, dependency management, and testing.
- **Accuracy and Context**: Provide highly accurate, context-aware coding suggestions by leveraging AI models trained on diverse codebases, adapting to project-specific patterns and user preferences.
- **Compatibility and Integration**: Ensure compatibility with various development environments and IDEs like VSCode, and integrate with existing tools and workflows through extensible APIs.
- **Documentation and Support**: Offer comprehensive documentation for setup, usage, and troubleshooting, alongside a knowledge base for error resolution and lessons learned to support continuous improvement.

## Target Audience
- **Developers**: Individual developers and teams seeking to enhance productivity through AI assistance in coding tasks.
- **Enterprises**: Organizations looking to integrate AI-driven coding tools into their development pipelines for efficiency gains.
- **Educators and Students**: Academic users who can benefit from AI assistance in learning and practicing coding skills.

## Use Cases
- **Code Generation**: Automatically generate boilerplate code, functions, or entire modules based on user prompts or project context.
- **Debugging Support**: Identify bugs, suggest fixes, and provide explanations for issues in the codebase.
- **Optimization**: Recommend performance improvements and refactoring opportunities to enhance code quality.
- **Learning Tool**: Assist in learning new programming languages or frameworks by providing real-time guidance and examples.

## Constraints
- **Performance**: Must handle large codebases and multiple simultaneous requests without significant latency.
- **Security**: Ensure user data and code are protected with appropriate security measures in API interactions and data storage.
- **Resource Usage**: Optimize resource consumption to run efficiently on standard developer hardware.

*Note: This document will be further refined with user feedback, detailed feature specifications, and prioritization of requirements as the project progresses.*
